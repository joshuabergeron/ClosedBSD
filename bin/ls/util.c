 * The fts system makes it difficult to replace fts_name with a different-

 *
 * XXX when using f_octal_escape (-b) rather than f_octal (-B), the
 * length computed by len_octal may be too big. I just can't be buggered
 * to fix this as an efficient fix would involve a lookup table. Same goes
 * for the rather inelegant code in prn_octal.
