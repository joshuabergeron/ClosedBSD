This file contains additional installation instructions for the ClosedBSD distribution. 

It is highly recommended that you use the RELENG_4_5 branch of FreeBSD sources on your system to build ClosedBSD.

When using CompactFlash, the build system can be used to create a partition image which will contain read-only and read/write partitions. XXX: document special flags to mount root read-only in this instance.

Additional instructions will appear here when ready.
