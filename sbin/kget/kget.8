.Sh NAME
.Nm kget
.Nd print kernel change information.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kget
.Ar filename
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility allows one to view or save any device configuration information
which was changed in userconfig (-c) session.  Most typically, it is written
to a /boot/kernel.conf file which is then loaded from /boot/loader.rc
(using "load -t userconfig_script /boot/kernel.conf"), saving the user
from having to re-enter it each time the system is booted.
.Pp
.Nm
uses the
.Xr sysctl 3
interface to retrieve data from the kernel and requires that at least
the
.Ar machdep.uc_devlist
symbol be present.  If it's not, you may need to update your kernel
before using this utility.
.Pp
Usage:
.Nm
.Ar filename
.Pp
where 
.Ar filename
is either a regular file (which is overwritten) or -, indicating that
standard output should be used.
.Sh BUGS
Sure to be some.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sysctl 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Fx 3.1 ,
as part of the PicoBSD distribution by
