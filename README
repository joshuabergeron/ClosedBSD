This is the top level of the ClosedBSD source directory. 

For copyright information, please see the file COPYRIGHT in this
directory (additional copyright information also exists for some
sources in this tree - please see the specific source directories for
more information).

The Makefile in this directory has a number of convenience targets for
building and mastering ClosedBSD boot images from the source tree. Most
of the time users can simply type 'make iso' and the build infrastructure
will DTRT. For more detailed information, please read the Makefile.

The build process has been completely reworked such that unattended builds
from source are now possible. Objects are built outside of the source tree
using the standard MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX semantics familiar to BSD systems.
