ClosedBSD is a FreeBSD derived firewall distribution bootable from
a cdrom, compact flash, or floppy diskette. It features a complete
ncurses based console for managing your firewall rulesets.

The ClosedBSD project is no longer maintained, however I've made 
the source available here in case anyone is interested in working 
with it or contributing to it. 

The last known release the ClosedBSD build was compatible with was
4.5-RELEASE. I have tried a few times to get the build process 
working with current FreeBSD releases, however critical things
have changed and the procedures need to be updated.

This is the top level of the ClosedBSD source directory. 

For copyright information, please see the file COPYRIGHT in this
directory (additional copyright information also exists for some
sources in this tree - please see the specific source directories for
more information).

The Makefile in this directory has a number of convenience targets for
building and mastering ClosedBSD boot images from the source tree. Most
of the time users can simply type 'make iso' and the build infrastructure
will DTRT. For more detailed information, please read the Makefile.

The build process has been completely reworked such that unattended builds
from source are now possible. Objects are built outside of the source tree
using the standard MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX semantics familiar to BSD systems.
