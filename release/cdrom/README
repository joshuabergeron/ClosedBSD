Maintainers: Don't forget to unconfigure vn0 before running the build, or
it will fail (unless you propagate an override for the VNDEV variable).
I've had a bash at automating this, but it doesn't currently work to
my satisfaction (it would require running a script to check for free
vn devices further up in the tree without reserving them, and this would
create a race condition of sorts).  So parallising the build is difficult.

Given that we're autonomous but not incremental build-wise this is not
so much of a loss, but would be a bigger win later.
