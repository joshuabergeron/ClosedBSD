Welcome to ClosedBSD 1.0-RC1!

You can enter the configuration utility at any time by running 'config'
from the shell prompt.  This utility allows you to configure your firewall
rules and network address translation abilities.  Advanced users are
recommended to use the 'advanced firewall configuration' option.

Novice users who don't have a lot of experience using ipfw can get by
with defaults in the 'basic firewall configuration' which automatically
places standard firewall rules, and enables network address translation
based on the interfaces you define; an external interface is required to
be defined prior to using this option.
